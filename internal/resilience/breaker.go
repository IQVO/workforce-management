// Package resilience holds the small pieces of circuit-breaker/timeout
// policy shared by every outbound cross-context HTTP client in this
// service (ADR-0022, ported verbatim from order-management's ADR-0025):
// the shared trip condition, the Prometheus-gauge wiring contract, and
// the context-deadline-propagation helper. It is a top-level internal
// package (a sibling of internal/adapters/outbound/bootretry), not a
// domain/application/adapter layer itself, so the hexagonal fitness
// tests place no restriction on who may import it — only the outbound
// adapters (laborperformance, fulfillmentexecution, telemetry) do
// today.
//
// One gobreaker.CircuitBreaker instance is constructed PER downstream
// dependency (never one global breaker) — see
// internal/adapters/outbound/laborperformance.NewBreakerClient and
// internal/adapters/outbound/fulfillmentexecution.NewBreakerClient, the
// two call sites that build a breaker using this package's shared
// tuning. A slow or failing dependency's breaker tripping can never
// affect the other dependency's breaker or its own bulkheaded
// *http.Client.

//     half-open cycle, so a still-broken dependency is confirmed broken
//     again with minimal extra load.

//     its rolling Counts. Without this, a failure streak from an hour
//     ago could combine with a fresh one to trip the breaker on stale

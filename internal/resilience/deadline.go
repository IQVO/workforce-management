// management's ADR-0025), instead of a hardcoded fresh timeout that
// could outlast the caller's own patience:
//
//   - ctx has a deadline and it is sooner than maxPerCall from now: the
//     returned context inherits that deadline unchanged (ctx itself is
//     returned as-is — no need to wrap it further, and doing so would
//     just add a redundant cancel func).
//   - ctx has no deadline, or one further away than maxPerCall: the
//     returned context is capped at maxPerCall from now, so a caller
//     with a very long or absent deadline (a background job, a test)
//     can never make a single outbound call hang indefinitely.
//
// The returned CancelFunc must always be called by the caller (typically
// via defer) — when ctx's own deadline is reused unchanged this is a
// cheap no-op wrapper, not a leak.

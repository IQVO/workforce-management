// Readiness is a process-wide, thread-safe readiness gate (ADR-0022
// §graceful shutdown, ported from order-management's ADR-0025): GET
// /readyz reflects it, separately from /healthz (liveness — "is the
// process alive", never flipped by shutdown) so a Kubernetes
// readinessProbe can be pointed at /readyz and a
// livenessProbe/startupProbe can stay pointed at /healthz exactly as
// they are today (see charts/workforce-management/values.yaml).
//
// The zero value is READY — a Handler built without explicitly wiring
// a Readiness (every existing test, and any caller that predates this
// type) behaves exactly as before, with /readyz always reporting
// ready.
